# An Ideal Approach for Detection and Prevention of Phishing Attacks

- Created Google Chrome extension using Javascript, PHP and Python for detecting phishing links in email for Gmail account users.
- The Javascript code fetches the links in email. 
- The links are then sent to PHP code where it is checked against our database of genuine URLs and phishing URLs and determines whether there is a possibility of it being a phishing link.
- The Python code is used for comparing the visual similarity of web pages based on links provided to confirm whether the link is genuine or phishing link.
- This project was presented at the International Conference on advances in computer, communication and control (ICAC3) and published in Procedia Computer Science Journal- Elsevier. Below is the link:
